Hopefully, there will be a chance to try it out soon, as we would like to invite you to a party which will take place on the day of our wedding. Obviously, we are not sure if it will be possible to organize it the way we would like to, but for now let's assume that our lives will become fairly normal by then!

We would like to invite you to join us at the celebration of our marriage on Saturday, July 18, 2020 at 12 noon (Pałac Ślubów, Plac Zmakowy 6, Warsaw Old Town), and then to a party which will start in the evening. We are anticipating that we will not be able to organize a gathering of more than 50 people, hence in the meantime we will spend a few hours with our families. At 7pm we will meet our friends in Art Bistro Instalacje (Ujazdowski Castle, Jazdów 2), where we are hoping to have an amazing night that will let us all forget about months of isolation. Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions, most importantly:
- We will confirm the plans at the beginning of June. It goes without saying that the situation is bit unstable, so we may need to change the plans for everyone's comfort and safety.
- Please let us know if you are planning to come, we will do our best to help you organize your stay in Warsaw. We would love to have you around (and your companion) on that special day :)
- If you wish to bless us with a gift but have no idea what would make us happy - your presence will make us utmost happy! And if you join us at night in a crazy costume, it will be the best gift ever :) We all deserve to go crazy that night!">
